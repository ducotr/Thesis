TODO:
- Only show relevant controls (only show semantic threshold when a semantic network is selected)
- Improve network, node and edge details and remove debug details
- Docstring every file and function
- For final version, set debug=False
- Write a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- Make central config file for all parameters and queries used (including random seeds)
