    "title": "urban digital twins for smart cities and citizens: the case study of herrenberg, germany",
    "abstract": "cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and demographic conditions and change. they are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. this to create democratic cities. connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of herrenberg in germany. urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. the herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3d model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (vgi). in addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the \u201cmorgenstadt werkstatt\u201d (tomorrow\u2019s cities workshop). the results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins. we conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions.",

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;many challenges to operate digital twins remain, hindering their design and implementation, and are rarely discussed. furthermore, issues of social and legal nature are often overlooked. we identify the challenges of operating digital twins in the urban context through a bifurcated and multi-dimensional approach: a systematic literature review and an expert survey. the review organises the identified challenges across technical and non-technical dimensions. as the topic is novel, the corpus is rather small and lacking the contextualisation of challenges. thus, we complement it with a survey based on the delphi method, involving a diverse panel of domain experts covering academia, industry and government organisations. combining the results, we identify 14 technical and 9 non-technical challenges and map them to phases of the digital twin's life cycle. the most severe challenges appear to be related to interoperability (e.g. disparate semantic standards) and practical value (e.g. lack of business models).&lt;/p&gt;",

    "abstract": "rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. in response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as generative artificial intelligence (genai), foundation models (fms), and urban digital twin (udt) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. these transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. despite recent progress, research on integrating genai and fms into udt frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. this study introduces a pioneering large flow model (lfm), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with genai capabilities. it is specifically tailored for integration into udt systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. to validate its applicability and relevance, the blue city project in lausanne city is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the lfm to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. this study highlights how the lfm addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current udt frameworks. the lfm demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. the model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. this research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of ai-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing genai and fms within udt frameworks. it provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "city information models (cims) present several research challenges and are arguably pre-cursors for a roadmap to the transition to urban or city digital twins (udts/cdts) and broader smart city drives. in a period of digital transformation in urban planning, cims are primarily designed to intersect and merge urban gis/bim in what is termed geobim. cims are often cloud-based geospatial services and data repositories with one-way data connections, which differ from integrated and high-fidelity cyber-physical complex systems for digital twins (dts). however, there is a lack of precision in terms of defining cims and udts, and this paper examines four broad sociotechnical research challenges regarding the progress of cims toward full udts/cdts, including (1) technical training for adoption, (2) acquisition strategies for aerial data and remote sensing, (3) data licensing types and system management, and (4) stakeholder engagement with cim platforms. these four research challenges and digital transformation are discussed by using back-casting futuring methods, establishing a framework for cims through co-designed workshops, and explored in the lancaster city information model (lcim) prototype. the lcim, as a resulting case study, was developed for architects, planners, and stakeholders to engage with 3d urban models and urban analytics (view sheds, masterplan scenarios, and solar potentials of buildings) from 2019 to 2021 to address digital inequality in planning and data fragmentation. the framework and prototype results resulted in the most extensive 3d open urban dataset published in the uk, consisting of a baseline of 1\u2033+/\u2212 buildings and infrastructure and 7.5 cm aerial imagery and a framework for developing transitions from cims to udts. the delivery of this case and the resulting published dataset highlights the essential research needed regarding definitions and precision around terminology and systems between cims and udts and four applied challenges in digital transformation and future socio-technical relationships.",

    "abstract": "with over 2 billion metric tons generated annually, global solid waste production has severe environmental consequences. although it is not a primary sustainable development goal, effective solid waste management (swm) is vital for meeting targets 11.6, 12.4, and 12.5. south africa, in particular, deals with significant sw generation and inadequate collection services. therefore, this paper presents an urban digital twin (udt) prototype to tackle these issues, involving stakeholder prioritization, integrating real-time monitoring, citizen participation, waste generation simulations, optimized collection routes, and a control dashboard where stakeholders\u2019 system requirements were included. the udt proposes optimized collection routes to reduce fuel use, operational costs, and emissions. the stakeholders\u2019 opinions on the usefulness of the udt varied due to their backgrounds and skills. most of them appreciated the dashboard visualization and the udt possibilities for resource optimization. the performance of the udt depends on computer capacity and local or online processing. this udt prototype sets the foundation for digital twinning in swm, scalable to different areas, vehicles, and production levels. the proposed approach, citizen involvement, and multi-stakeholder engagement enhance the swm, benefiting resource-limited countries.",

    "abstract": "a key feature for urban digital twins (dts) is an automatically generated detailed 3d representation of the built and unbuilt environment from aerial imagery, footprints, lidar, or a fusion of these. such 3d models have applications in architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, construction, real estate, geographical information systems (gis), and many other areas. while the visualization of large-scale data in conjunction with the generated 3d models is often a recurring and resource-intensive task, an automated workflow is complex, requiring many steps to achieve a high-quality visualization. methods for building reconstruction approaches have come a long way, from previously manual approaches to semi-automatic or automatic approaches. this paper aims to complement existing methods of 3d building generation. first, we present a literature review covering different options for procedural context generation and visualization methods, focusing on workflows and data pipelines. next, we present a semi-automated workflow that extends the building reconstruction pipeline to include procedural context generation using python and unreal engine. finally, we propose a workflow for integrating various types of large-scale urban analysis data for visualization. we conclude with a series of challenges faced in achieving such pipelines and the limitations of the current approach. however, the steps for a complete, end-to-end solution involve further developing robust systems for building detection, rooftop recognition, and geometry generation and importing and visualizing data in the same 3d environment, highlighting a need for further research and development in this field.",

    "title": "a conceptual framework to analyze urban digital twins interoperability",
    "abstract": "infrastructure and urban network operators, city users and industrialists are faced with complex issues to ensure the sustainability of the service, maintain, operate and develop their urban sys-tems, while integrating environmental, economic and societal impacts and being resilient to un-expected geopolitical and climatic upheavals. urban digital twins (udts), i.e., digital twins for smart cities and territories are considered as promising tools that can enable all stakeholders to collaborate across disciplinary silos and foster digital transformation in urban and territorial pro-jects to ensure sustainability, resilience and increased inventiveness. however, a widely acknowledged challenge to address in the application of udts is the lack of interoperability. one significant barrier is the difficulty that stakeholders have in understanding the level of complexity hidden behind this challenge, and thus the adoption of an adequate interoperability technique. this paper proposes a conceptual framework, which is unique for understanding the various lev-els of interoperability required in deploying and using the full potentials of udts. we show how such a high-level modeling approach supports the symbolic manipulation of udts interoperabil-ity notions and requirements, and thus eases the design of appropriate solutions for large-scale in-teroperable udts.",

    "abstract": "abstract in this paper, we make a case for (1) a sociotechnical understanding and (2) a commoning approach to the governance of digital twin technologies applied to the urban environment. the european union has reinstated many times over the willingness to pursue a citizen-centric approach to digital transformation. however, recent studies show the limits of a human right-based only approach in that this overlooks consequences of data-driven technologies at societal level. the need to synthesize an individual-based and collective-based approach within an ecosystemic vision is key, especially when it comes to cities, which are complex systems affected by problems whose solutions require forms of self-organization. tackling the limitations of current tech-centered and practice-first city digital twin (cdt) projects in europe, in this article, we conceptualize the idea of urban digital twinning (udt) as a process that is contextual, iterative, and participatory. unpacking the normative understanding of data-as-resource, we claim that a commoning approach to data allows enacting a fair ecosystemic vision of the digitalization of the urban environment which is ultimately both citizen- and citizenry-centric.",

    "abstract": "abstract. urban digital twins, and 3d city models underpinning them, provide novel solutions to urban management but tend to overlook the human element. the trending research on human perception reveals people\u2019s perspective towards interpreting and experiencing the built environment. advancing the representation of building physics and descriptive information in 3d city models and urban digital twins, we establish the addition and integration of the notion of how humans perceive buildings. unlocking a new dimension in our domain, this new concept can facilitate a broader adoption of semantic 3d data in socio-economic fields across various domains, and advance existing use cases in 3d gis. this work is the first instance of integrating such attributes in 3d city models, which have traditionally been confined to physical and objective measures. the visual perception of each building is evaluated based on building images extracted from street view images. we add such information as new attributes to an existing cityjson dataset representing thousands of 3d buildings in amsterdam, the netherlands. to facilitate a robust and sustainable integration, we develop a cityjson extension to accommodate the new data and validate its schema successfully, and we visualise the semantic 3d dataset. further, we present two use cases to demonstrate the usability of our new data for downstream analysis. one is the concurrent clustering of buildings based on 3d morphology and human perception, while the other is conducting an attribute-based query that enables various stakeholders to identify a particular building of interest combining both traditional and perception attributes.",

    "abstract": "the desired outcome for urban digital twins is an automatically generated detailed 3d model of a building from aerial imagery, footprints, lidar, or a fusion of these. such 3d models have applications in architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, construction, real estate, gis, and many others. further, the visualization of large-scale data in conjunction with the generated 3d models is often a recurring and resource-intensive task. however, a completely automated end-to-end workflow is complex, requiring many steps to achieve a high-quality visualization. methods for building reconstruction approaches have come a long way from previously manual approaches to semi-automatic or automatic approaches. the next step after reconstructing buildings is visualizing the buildings and their context. advances in real-time rendering using game engines have enabled the extension of building reconstruction methods to procedurally generated context generation. this paper aims to complement existing methods of 3d building generation. first, we present a literature review covering different options for procedurally generated context generation and visualization methods in-depth, focusing on workflows and data pipelines. next, we present a semi-automated workflow that extends the building reconstruction pipeline to include procedural context generation (terrain and vegetation) using unreal engine and, finally, the integration of various types of large-scale urban analysis data for visualization. we conclude with a series of challenges faced in achieving such pipelines and the limitations of the current approach. the steps for a complete, end-to-end solution involve developing robust systems for building detection, rooftop recognition, and geometry generation and importing and visualizing data in the same 3d environment.",

    "abstract": "the urban digital twin (udt) is derived from the original digital-twin concept of a representation of physical assets. this has left the social component of the city underrepresented in udts. here, we discuss what this means for the current maturity stage of udts and why better representing human behaviour in udts may diversify possibilities to support different types of planning. we contemplate operationalizing the representation of human behaviour by means of agent-based models (abms) integrated with udts and illustrate this with two concrete examples of simulating stress and safety perception in public spaces. one example shows the idea of the udt as a live data repository for abms, with the abm adding dynamism, and the other of live feedback between the city, the abm and udt. we discuss several epistemological, conceptual, technical, and ethical challenges that may be involved in this integration. we conclude with a future agenda to promote (1) the abandonment of the vision of a udt as the highly detailed mirror of the city, (2) udts fit for sectoral (strategic) in addition to operational planning, (3) the inclusion of behavioural and social processes in udts by incorporating abms, (4) a culture of cumulative research using structured guided frameworks and reusable building blocks, (5) abms with explicit purposes to allow fit-for-purpose selection in udts, and (6) explicitly addressing epistemic, normative, and moral responsibilities. thus, though including agents may at some point be a solution for the (currently lacking) perspective on the role of humans in shaping and being shaped by the city, several reconsiderations in the udt and abm communities need to take place first.",

    "abstract": "abstract. this paper investigates the challenges of implementing the citygml standard within database environments for managing urban digital twins (udt), with a particular focus on addressing big geodata issues. citygml stands as a critical standard for representing and exchanging 3d urban models and thematic data, essential for effective urban planning and infrastructure management. however, integrating citygml into databases poses challenges due to the dual requirements of geospatial and semi-structured data. while the former imposes a certain rigor in its formalism, the second benefits from more flexibility. through a comprehensive review and benchmarking of existing database implementations, including both new distributions and those often use, 3dcitydb, cjdb, measur3d, and cerbere, this paper proposes a novel approach towards a multi-database citygml environment tailored to the specific needs of udt. the proposed solution leverages the strengths of both relational and nosql databases, offering a flexible and scalable architecture while ensuring data consistency, geospatial capabilities and compliance with the citygml schema. the research hypothesis suggests integrating cerbere, a middleware for citygml schema compliance and transaction validation, with 3dcitydb and measur3d (mongodb). this approach aims to demonstrate the feasibility of managing advanced 3d data operations based on the citygml model (3dcitydb) and scalability for big data like iot (measur3d) within a multi-database environment. the paper contributes to the advancement of udt by providing a comprehensive solution for managing diverse data types, facilitating more effective urban planning, infrastructure management, and sustainable development initiatives in the context of smart cities.",

    "title": "moving from monitoring to real-time interventions for air quality: are low-cost sensor networks ready to support urban digital twins?",
    "abstract": "modern cities now have an increasing multitude of internet-of-things data streams on urban phenomena, including transport, mobility, and meteorology. one area of development has been the use of low-cost sensors to complement (or in some cases, substitute for) regulatory monitoring of ambient air pollution. as part of a bigger integrated approach to monitoring cities, such as urban observatories, disparate live data streams can now readily be collated and disseminated via a platform to facilitate the use of hyperlocal data for real-time decision making whilst supporting longer term sustainable development goals. urban digital twins are the next logical step on this journey and these are becoming increasingly popular as a tool, at least conceptually, to better interpret this data as well as better understand the consequences of management interventions. to date, there are few examples of true digital twins of environmental challenges with many limited to the \u2018digital shadow\u2019 stage of development, characterized by lack of bi-directional feedback between the digital model and physical world. urban observatories present an opportunity to change this by providing the often overlooked, but crucial, underpinning foundations of urban digital twins. this paper focuses on the utilization of live stream data and demonstrates that air quality applications can provide a realistic target given the density of observations available, which can routinely be combined with other urban datasets to provide the added value and insights needed for urban air pollution management. however, the availability and standardization of live streams of big data is a major challenge and there are issues with interoperability, metadata management, communicating uncertainty, network longevity, data ownership and transparency. this paper contributes insights concerning how to overcome these challenges and calls for common practice in generating and managing live streams of big data.",

    "title": "urban revitalization pathways toward zero carbon emissions through systems architecting of urban digital twins",
    "abstract": "recognizing the critical role of cities in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, many cities are adopting carbon neutrality goals as part of their climate action strategies. the efficacy of these initiatives, however, has been undermined by complexity of systemic problems, ineffectiveness in planning implementation, and lack of stakeholder engagement. urban and community-level carbon reduction should transcend urban design and systems optimization to incorporate multi-faceted dimensions in urban contexts. to address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework of urban digital twins that includes digital representation, performance modeling, design interventions and interactive platform for decisions over temporal processes. the canvas, or carbon neutrality architecting new visions for architectural systems, is a systems architecting approach to modeling the process of urban revitalization for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. the developed workflow integrates multidisciplinary approaches for carbon mapping, gap identification, alternative generation, urban building energy modeling (ubem) simulation, evaluation, and decision-making to demonstrates applicability of the proposed framework through a case study of the nihonbashi district in tokyo. the approach revealed that energy use intensity (eui) can be decreased by 99 kwh/m 2 /y through reconstruction and operational improvements. emerging photovoltaic technologies can further cut eui by an average of 42.5 kwh/m 2 /y, although results vary significantly in respect to building characteristics, particularly geometry and floor area. the incremental, cyclical systems architecting approach revealed that a 97% reduction in carbon emissions could be achieved by the seventh cycle through stakeholder-centric system interventions. this paper contributes to the development of urban digital twin methodologies by integrating systems architecting concepts with ubem as transformative tools for carbon neutral urban design and development.",

    "abstract": "abstract. this paper presents a concept and first glimpse at the development of an urban digital twin framework to estimate and forecast the carbon footprints of urban neighbourhoods, with a focus on household consumption choices, specifically in buildings, food, and transportation sectors, as key emission contributors. despite constituting nearly three-quarters of global carbon emissions, the influence of household consumption choices on a region\u2019s carbon footprint is often neglected. while assessments at a regional or city scale may prove too broad for targeted mitigation strategies, estimating carbon emissions at the neighbourhood scale can foster sustainable and resilient urban areas. however, challenges arise in estimating emissions at this scale due to the availability of aggregated data, insufficient cross-sectoral data integration, and a lack of practical visualisation tools, causing policymakers to overlook the impact of household choices on neighbourhood carbon footprints. therefore, the present article provides insights into the ongoing early-stage development of using urban digital twins to model, simulate, analyse, and visualise the impact of household consumption choices on neighbourhood-scale consumption-based carbon emissions. by exploring \u201dwhat-if\u201d scenarios, this research also seeks to forecast emission profiles based on how household consumption choices influence a neighbourhood\u2019s carbon emissions under future climatic and demographic conditions.",

    "title": "large-scale solar potential analysis in a 3d cad framework as a use case of urban digital twins",
    "abstract": "solar radiation impacts diverse aspects of city life, such as harvesting energy with pv panels, passive heating of buildings in winter, cooling the loads of air-conditioning systems in summer, and the urban microclimate. urban digital twins and 3d city models can support solar studies in the process of urban planning and provide valuable insights for data-driven decision support. this study examines the calculation of solar incident radiation at the city scale in sofia using remote sensing data for the large shading context in a mountainous region and 3d building data. it aims to explore the methods of geometry optimisation, limitations, and performance issues of a 3d computer-aided design (cad) tool dedicated to small-scale solar analysis and employed at the city scale. two cases were considered at the city and district scales, respectively. the total face count of meshes for the simulations constituted approximately 2,000,000 faces. a total of 64,379 roofs for the whole city and 4796 buildings for one district were selected. all calculations were performed in one batch and visualised in a 3d web platform. the use of a 3d cad environment establishes a seamless process of updating 3d models and simulations, while preprocessing in geographic information system (gis) ensures working with large-scale datasets. the proposed method showed a moderate computation time for both cases and could be extended to include reflected radiation and dense photogrammetric meshes in the future.",

    "title": "urban digital twins for citizen-centric planning: a systematic review of built environment perception and public participation",
    "abstract": "in the context of rapid urbanization, enhancing built environment perception and promoting public participation has become critical in urban planning. urban digital twins (udts) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling real-time simulation, immersive visualization, and interactive engagement with complex urban systems. this systematic review examines 84 publications (2014\u20132024) on the application of udts for enhancing built-environment perception and facilitating public participation in urban planning. results indicate a rapid increase in udt research post-2020, particularly in north america, europe, and asia, led by the united states, china, and germany. however, significant gaps remain, notably the underrepresentation of rural and peri-urban contexts, highlighting geographic and contextual biases. udt studies primarily focus on visual and functional perception, with limited attention to auditory and risk perception dimensions. additionally, most research concentrates on meso-scale (neighbourhood or city-level) contexts, revealing scale-specific limitations. public participation varied widely, with academia and government predominantly driving initiatives, while direct citizen engagement remained comparatively limited. interactive participation through immersive visualization technologies (e.g., vr, ar) effectively enhanced stakeholder involvement and perceptual understanding, yet raised equity concerns regarding accessibility and technological inclusivity. future udt research should prioritize expanding into diverse geographic and contextual settings, incorporating overlooked perceptual dimensions, and developing equitable, accessible technologies. embracing hybrid participatory models and interoperable, geospatially-aware frameworks will be crucial for leveraging udts as comprehensive tools for citizen-centric and sustainable urban planning.",

    "abstract": "despite the abundance of urban data available and the possibility of improving decision making city administration skills, and infrastructure, contemporary data driven methods for city data based knowledge discovery cannot frequently use collective data. in a loose manner specified elements for data interpretation, or disciplinary discrete analyses of particular datasets make it simple to ignore essential subject knowledge, frequently leading to speculative decisions. intelligent city digital twins are intended to get past this obstacle by incorporating analytics and visualization that are more comprehensive approaches to knowledge discovery in real time procedure from diverse city data. here, we offer a spatiotemporal knowledge discovery framework that integrates social and sensor data and allows for insights from human cognition for the collective exploitation of city data in smart city digital twins. even though these applications are effective, they frequently use vast quantities of high dimensional and multi domain data to monitor and characterize various urban sub systems. this poses problems in application areas where data availability and quality are restricted, as well as expensive efforts to generate urban scenarios and design alternatives. generative artificial intelligence (genai) models are a new field of study in deep learning that has shown promise in producing original material. with an emphasis on several urban sub systems, including building and infrastructure, energy, water, and transportation, this article attempts to investigate the creative integration of genai approaches with urban digital twins to address issues in the planning and administration of built environments.",

    "title": "integrating 3d survey and open datasets for creating low-cost urban digital twins in vr",
    "abstract": "abstract. this paper presents a low-cost framework for creating urban digital twins in virtual reality (vr) tailored for heritage preservation and smart city applications. the increasing demand for urban digital twins necessitates an integration of diverse data sources to enhance urban management, particularly in historical contexts where traditional methods may lack necessary specificity. to address this, our research integrates advanced 3d survey techniques (mostly low-cost) with publicly available datasets to develop a semantically rich, detailed urban digital model aligned with specific requirements of each unique urban setting.the methodology hinges on three pivotal stages: data acquisition, data management, and data accessibility. data acquisition involves collecting extensive data both from existing datasets and 3d surveys, emphasizing on identifying optimal, cost-effective solutions suited to the surveyed area. data management is achieved using a broker database coupled with a web application programming interface (web api), ensuring the integrity of original databases while enabling flexible system implementation. data accessibility extends to a broad range of applications, including gis, bim, and customized applications, enhancing the scalability of the digital twin model.the test ground of this system is a vr application developed with unity, which serves as the interactive platform for the digital twin model. the proposed framework is validated through three case studies in distinct urban settings, each chosen to illustrate the framework's adaptability, versatility, and effectiveness in different urban complexities. the results demonstrate the potential of the digital twin model in facilitating detailed urban management tasks, promoting sustainable heritage conservation, and fostering smarter urban environments.",

    "abstract": "abstract. the proliferation of affordable lidar technology and photogrammetry sensors has revolutionized 3d data acquisition in built environments, enabling comprehensive data capture from citywide scales to interior structures. this data can be transformed into digital twins, providing valuable resources for city planners, architects, engineers, and decision-makers. however, current studies often overlook the limitations of real-world point cloud datasets derived from lidar systems, which are voluminous, noisy, incomplete, and lacking information, which hinders monitoring, interpretation, and automated analysis. to address these challenges, methods are required to prepare point cloud data, ensuring accurate and reliable 3d representations. this research proposes a detailed framework for point cloud data preparation in busy urban environments. it includes precise algorithms, software, and parameter guidelines, allowing for the creation of comprehensive point cloud datasets. the framework has been successfully implemented on datasets acquired in toronto, converting point cloud data from various platforms and parameters into an integrated dataset. results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing accurate and complete point cloud datasets for applications such as classification, information extraction, 3d model generation, and smart cities' monitoring and management.",

    "abstract": "the dynamic landscape of sustainable smart cities is witnessing a significant transformation due to the integration of emerging computational technologies and innovative models. these advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. this transformative wave signals a fundamental shift - marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (ai), artificial intelligence of things (aiot), and urban digital twin (udt) technologies. while previous research has largely explored urban ai, urban aiot, and udt in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. to address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. what theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of ai, aiot, udt, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. how does integrating ai and aiot reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. how can ai and aiot augment the capabilities of udt to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. what challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing ai, aiot, and udt in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between january 2019 and december 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. the findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating ai, aiot, and udt technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. by enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. however, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. this study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development. these insights have profound implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing a roadmap for fostering resiliently designed, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious urban environments.",

    "title": "getting real: the challenge of building and validating a large-scale digital twin of barcelona\u2019s traffic with empirical data",
    "abstract": "large-scale microsimulations are increasingly resourceful tools for analysing in detail citywide effects and alternative scenarios of our policy decisions, approximating the ideal of \u2018urban digital twins\u2019. yet, these models are costly and impractical, and there are surprisingly few published examples robustly validated with empirical data. this paper, therefore, presents a new large-scale agent-based traffic microsimulation for the barcelona urban area using sumo to show the possibilities and challenges of building these scenarios based on novel fine-grained empirical big data. it combines novel mobility data from real cell phone records with conventional surveys to calibrate the model comparing two different dynamic assignment methods for getting an operationally realistic and efficient simulation. including through traffic and the use of a stochastic adaptive routing approach results in a larger 24-hour model closer to reality. based on an extensive multi-scalar evaluation including traffic counts, hourly distribution of trips, and macroscopic metrics, this model expands and outperforms previous large-scale scenarios, which provides new operational opportunities in city co-creation and policy. the novelty of this work relies on the effective modelling approach using newly available data and the realistic robust evaluation. this allows the identification of the fundamental challenges of simulation to accurately capture real-world dynamical systems and to their predictive power at a large scale, even when fed by big data, as envisioned by the digital twin concept applied to smart cities.",

    "abstract": "this study explores the feasibility of using generative ai to enhance spatial and legislative opportunity finding within urban digital twins. digital twins (dts) integrate real-time and historical data to provide comprehensive views of built environments, potentially aiding different disciplines involved in spatial planning practices. however, the complexity of legal frameworks and their visualization in dts remains a challenge. leveraging advancements in large language models (llms), this research investigates how multimodal ai can interpret complex legislative data to improve spatial planning. the study employs a design science research (dsr) methodology, focusing on tuning existing llms with spatial content. key findings include the successful generation of geography markup language (gml) code, enhancing interoperability with spatial planning tools, and the iterative design process that improved the model's performance. preliminary results indicate that a multimodal approach, including text, images, and gml code, significantly enhances the model's capability. future research will focus on improving data quality, expanding multimodal capabilities, and evaluating real-world applications. this study contributes to the development of transparent, contestable, and explainable ai solutions for spatial planning.",

    "abstract": "abstract. more and more cities declare themselves to be a smart city or plan to be the same. smart cities require a solid data source as basis for all further actions and the urban digital twin is the basis on which all information is collected and analysed. the urban digital twin is much more than just a 3d city model, but often this together with gis data is the starting point for the urban digital twin. the basis of the urban digital twin is formed by geospatial data in the form of the geospatial digital twin. the digital twin hereby acts as a kind of hub into which all relevant and available information is included and analysed. to generate a geospatial digital twin aerial sensors that collect multiple data simultaneously, hybrid sensors, are perfectly suited for this task. in aerial data acquisition a new era started with the introduction of the first real hybrid sensor systems, like the leica citymapper-2. hybrid in this context means the combination of an (oblique) camera system with a topographic lidar into an integrated aerial mapping system. by combining these complimentary sub-systems into one system the weaknesses of the one system could be compensated by using the alternative data source. an example is the mapping of low-light urban canyons, where image-based systems mostly produce unreliable results. for an lidar sensor the geometrical reconstruction of these areas is straight forward and leads to accurate results. the paper gives a detailed overview over the development and technical characteristics of hybrid sensor systems. the process of data acquisition is discussed and strategies for hybrid urban mapping are proposed. furthermore, the paper provides insights into the advantage of lidar data for the 3d mesh generation for urban modelling and on the possibilities to generate new products from the combination of the single products with the help of geoai. finally, the use and some use cases of the hybrid sensor data and the derived products in the context of the urban digital twin is discussed and with the infinite loop of data, analysis, and action it is shown, that all data from the urban digital twin can only be a snapshot at a given point in time and the data recording and analysis is a permanent loop.",

    "abstract": "abstract. the country-scale 3d city model of the netherlands, 3dbag, has been extensively utilized across multiple disciplines. buildings in 3dbag include many attributes, but they lack the necessary ones required for precise urban climate modeling. this study aims to enhance the 3dbag 3d city model by incorporating energy-related attributes and vegetation data, thereby improving visualization accuracy and realism, as well as enabling more precise urban climate simulations. automated methods were developed to extract and integrate key features such as roof textures, fa\u00e7ade materials, albedo values, roof slopes, and urban vegetation. roof textures extracted from orthophotos enhance the analysis of roof geometry and facilitate material identification and solar panel detection. meanwhile, fa\u00e7ade materials and albedo values contribute to more accurate simulations of heat absorption, energy balance, and urban heat island effects. furthermore, the integration of detailed urban vegetation data, including tree height and crown diameter, allows for accurate modeling of vegetation's influence on urban microclimates. developed automated workflows significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual data preparation and integration. by enriching the urban digital twins with energy-related information, this study provides researchers with a more comprehensive and precise dataset, enabling more accurate analyses in urban climate modeling. the developed automated workflows can be applied in future releases of the 3dbag, allowing other users in utilizing the energy-enriched 3d city model effectively. web-based visualization of the energy-enriched 3d city model can be explored at https://bit.ly/4tuheritage.",

    "abstract": "the urban energy transition is a cornerstone of achieving sustainable development goals in the face of rapid urbanization and escalating energy demands. however, existing approaches to energy and spatial planning often struggle to integrate energy sectors and supporting infrastructures efficiently. this research explores the potential of urban digital twins (udts) as interactive platforms to bridge this gap, providing comprehensive, real-time view of the urban energy system for multiple stakeholders and enhancing the efficiency and resilience of urban energy system.by integrating urban and environmental entities, real-time sensor energy data, historical energy usage records, and dynamic climate variables, the digital twin platform could monitor energy production, consumption and supporting infrastructure, and visualize the interplay between energy system and urban environment. the model could be utilized to simulate and forecast energy production, demand and consumption when combined with data analysis tools and ai, enhancing the efficiency of decision-making and operational process.leveraging case studies based on dutch cities, design-based research, and mixed methods, this study aims to construct a comprehensive review of the existing dutch urban digital twin model and clarify their effectiveness in facilitating energy transition, especially in the enhancement of urban energy system\u2019s sustainability and resilience.the findings aim to address the knowledge gaps in udt application to the urban energy system and their role in urban energy planning. this approach not only supports immediate operational improvements but also paves the way for long-term strategic planning towards urban sustainability and resilience. the findings suggest that digital twin technology is a powerful tool for facilitating the energy transition, offering a forward-thinking framework that can be adapted to other urban contexts globally.key words: urban digital twins (udts), energy transition, energy system, energy production and consumption, infrastructure, sustainability and resilience, dutch cities",

    "abstract": "more recently, coverage and promotion of urban digital twins within mainstream media outlets, urban and technology focused publications, trade press, and scholarly journals has increased visibility and awareness of these 3d, interactive images as tools for urban management and urban planning. rose offers compelling theoretical foundations for understanding these types of urban data imaginaries and technologized visions of cities. in this response, i recognize the importance of rose's cultural reading and critique of urban digital twins while briefly looking at the discursive construction of digital twins through slightly different cultural comparisons. it is imperative to investigate the types of changes enacted, ethnographic understandings of how decisions are made, technological affordances that inform these decisions, and the types of places created through the use of urban digital twins. in considering similar issues of race and gender in the \u201cvolumetricisation\u201d of the city, i want to suggest that urban digital twins are more closely related to spectacles of prevention and preparation than disaster as well as sensory experiences of media that spotlight the apparatus of their own production (satellite or live television, video games, operational aesthetics) rather than disaster films. in fact, there may be a de-emphasis of disaster in the discursive construction of \u201cactually existing\u201d urban digital twins. the mundane simulation of risk and risk mitigation may indicate a shift in smart city rhetoric overall, albeit not in the socio-technical imaginaries and power relations that substantiate and benefit from \u201csmartness\u201d.",

    "abstract": "abstract. recent years have seen a significant and rapid rise in the development and deployment of many urban digital twins worldwide. urban digital twins provide a central platform for incorporating data and knowledge from different sources and fields, and can thus be used for many urban-related processes such as urban planning, analysis, monitoring and visualization. one of the key requirements of digital twins in general and urban digital twins in particular is the continuous, bidirectional data flow between the physical entity and its digital counterpart. consequently, this requires the ability to both detect and understand changes between different temporal versions of the physical and digital entities. in the context of smart cities and semantic 3d city models however, only a few studies have addressed this so far. this is due to the facts that: (1) semantic 3d city models (mostly encoded in citygml) contain multifaceted information modelled in a complex inheritance hierarchy, which complicates their change detection process; (2) as cities constantly evolve over time, matching their datasets often results in a large number of changes, which must be further analysed and processed to produce meaningful information; (3) individual changes in the datasets are multi-layered as well as often correlated and cannot be fully understood without considering their context in the city model; and (4) different types of changes are perceived and interpreted differently by different stakeholders, meaning that the outcome of the change detection and interpretation process must ultimately serve the human factor. therefore, to address these challenges, this research proposes a path-tracing semantic network (psn) to interpret detected changes in semantic 3d city models. the framework represents the multidimensional nature of changes together with stakeholders in a semantic network, where their interrelations can be analysed explicitly using graph-based path-tracing methods.",

    "abstract": "abstract the increased effects of climate change in the built environment require a rapid and effective response to adapt urban settlements to the main impacts related to heatwave, extreme precipitation, sea-level rise, and so on. at the same time, there is not much time to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions that contribute to climate change and limit the mean temperature of the planet within the 1.5 \u00b0c imposed by the paris agreement. in this perspective, cities around the world have a key role toward carbon neutral and resilient targets. in parallel in the last years, we are witnessing the impacts of a big amount of data and information available at the city scale. there are many data coming from different databases that can be processed and managed to support the urban climate action planned and designed by decision-makers and urban practitioners, for example, to assess the carbon emission of the building sector or to simulate the effects of extreme precipitation or urban heat island and consequence behavior of the built environment. in this scenario, in the last years, among many different digital enable technologies available in the industry 4.0 ambit, it has gained more attention in the field of urban planning and urban design the digital twin concept that could synthesize in a digital representation of the real-world data and information flow that could exchange from the physical side to digital representation and vice versa. the aim of the paper is to analyze the urban digital twin developed in last years in europe to evaluate if and how they consider the climate change issue, in order to understand the state of the art, the applications developed for climate change and which is the level of experimentation in order to study and develop guidelines to build urban digital twin as a support tool for a climate-neutral and resilient city.",

    "abstract": "predictive maintenance of built assets often relies on scheduled routine practices that are disconnected from real-time stress assessment, degradation and defects. however, while digital twin (dt) technology within building and urban studies is maturing rapidly, its use in predictive maintenance is limited. traditional preventive and reactive maintenance strategies that are more prevalent in facility management are not intuitive, not resource efficient, cannot prevent failure and either underserve the asset or are surplus to requirements. city information modeling (cim) refers to a federation of bim models in accordance with real-world geospatial references, and it can be deployed as an urban digital twin (udt) at city level, like bim\u2019s deployment at building level. this study presents a systematic review of 105 scopus-indexed papers to establish current trends, gaps and opportunities for a cognitive predictive maintenance framework in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (aeco) industry. a udt framework consisting of the cim of a section of the university of florida campus is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap highlighted in the systematic review. the framework illustrates the potential for cnn-iot integration to improve predictive maintenance through advance notifications. it also eliminates the use of centralized information archiving.",

    "abstract": "urban digital twins and realistic three-dimensional (3d) scenes have further enhanced the ever-increasing demand for building models. airborne laser scanning (als) point clouds are the predominant data source for 3d building reconstruction owing to their highly detailed spatial features. however, information on the reconstruction of compound buildings (i.e. buildings with diverse plane structures or various roof structures) is lacking. existing methods often produce building models that suffer from topological inconsistencies and/or geometric errors. to address these issues, this study proposes an automatic building reconstruction approach based on als point cloud that offers both modeling flexibility and geometric consistency. specifically, a structure-aware partitioning algorithm that partitions a complex building roof into several regular roof patches is incorporated. subsequently, a primitive model library comprising representative primitives suitable for building reconstruction is created. suitable primitive model selection and reconstruction optimization are employed to ensure the accuracy and compactness in the final model. to comprehensively evaluate the performance, two typical als point cloud datasets are tested. experiments demonstrate the generated models can achieve a boundary consistency of 92% while ensuring root mean square error below 0.09 m. comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in compound building reconstruction.",

    "title": "georeferencing building information models for bim/gis integration: a review of methods and tools",
    "abstract": "with the rise of urban digital twins and smart cities, the integration of building information modeling (bim) and geospatial information systems (giss) have captured the interest of researchers. although significant advancements have been achieved in this field, challenges persist in the georeferencing of bim models, which is one of the fundamental challenges in integrating bim and gis models. these challenges stem from dissimilarities between the bim and gis domains, including different georeferencing definitions, different coordinate systems utilization, and a lack of correspondence between the engineering system of bim and the project\u2019s geographical location. this review critically examines the significance of georeferencing within this integration, outlines and compares various methods for georeferencing bim data in detail, and surveys existing software tools that facilitate this process. the findings underscore the need for increased attention to georeferencing issues from both domains, aiming to enhance the seamless integration of bim and gis.",

    "title": "towards limiting semantic data loss in 4d urban data semantic graph generation",
    "abstract": "abstract. to enrich urban digital twins and better understand city evolution, the integration of heterogeneous, spatio-temporal data has become a large area of research in the enrichment of 3d and 4d (3d + time) semantic city models. these models, which can represent the 3d geospatial data of a city and their evolving semantic relations, may require data-driven integration approaches to provide temporal and concurrent views of the urban landscape. however, data integration often requires the transformation or conversion of data into a single shared data format, which can be prone to semantic data loss. to combat this, this paper proposes a model-centric ontology-based data integration approach towards limiting semantic data loss in 4d semantic urban data transformations to semantic graph formats. by integrating the underlying conceptual models of urban data standards, a unified spatio-temporal data model can be created as a network of ontologies. transformation tools can use this model to map datasets to interoperable semantic graph formats of 4d city models. this paper will firstly illustrate how this approach facilitates the integration of rich 3d geospatial, spatio-temporal urban data and semantic web standards with a focus on limiting semantic data loss. secondly, this paper will demonstrate how semantic graphs based on these models can be implemented for spatial and temporal queries toward 4d semantic city model enrichment.",

    "abstract": "abstract. semantic 3d city models can serve as anchor points for different components of urban digital twins. in addition to static 3d models such as buildings, transportation infrastructure, vegetation, or city furniture, this can also include dynamic processes such as traffic movement or changing traffic signals. integrating these aspects into a dynamic, realistic, and accessible 4d visualization presents a number of requirements and challenges, which are discussed. while the city geography markup language (citygml) is a well established ogc standard for modeling and exchanging semantic 3d city models, the cesium language (czml) provides capabilities for visualizing time-dependant properties that can be displayed in the cesium virtual globe. results of the open-source microscopic traffic simulation tool sumo include information on locations and orientations of vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and other traffic members as well as traffic signal information and can be exported as a csv table. in order to allow a 4d visualization of these simulation results, a scheme for deriving 3d + t czml documents from data given as 2d + t csv files is presented. additionally, dynamically changing traffic lights are integrated. based on data available for the city of munich, a citygmlcompliant streetspace model is generated. this enables the combination of traffic simulation results and semantic 3d city models within a common cesium based web-visualization and allows a direct and platform independent access to realistic visualizations of streetspace activities. since this often results in a huge amount of data, a spatio-temporal tiling strategy enabling the visualization of large czml data is presented.",

    "abstract": "abstractlidar scanning is a widely-used method for accurately assessing roads and vehicular infrastructure. however, it can be costly and often overlooks infrastructure important for vulnerable road users (vru) like pedestrians and cyclists. advances in electronics now permit high-performance lidar sensors made of standard semiconductor materials to be integrated into personal devices like smartphones and tablets. this study introduces a new classification category of handheld lidar systems for the purpose of vru infrastructure mapping on a smaller scale. qualitative experiments using a handheld lidar system were conducted to achieve low-cost mobile mapping of vru infrastructure. the 3d scanner app facilitated detailed and qualitative point cloud generation at low speeds. moreover, it demonstrated precise detection of perpendicular potholes and bumps on roads. a quantitative analysis based on several infrastructure damages was performed, revealing mean average percentage errors of 3.53%, 4.43%, and 10.57% in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively. while the accuracy in the x- and y-directions is acceptable, the higher z-direction error indicates overestimation of infrastructural damage depth. in conclusion, the sensor's capabilities enable cost-effective mobile mapping solutions for vru infrastructure monitoring, such as crowd-sourcing for urban data mining and urban digital twin interfaces, significantly reducing expenses compared to traditional sensors.keywords: low-cost lidar sensorhandheld lidar systemvru infrastructure mappingmobile 3d mappingurban data mining acknowledgmentsthe authors confirm their contribution to this study as follows:all authors reviewed the results and approved the final version of the manuscript.disclosure statementno potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

    "abstract": "the increasing number of crises, including natural disasters and military conflicts, underscores the importance of resilient critical infrastructures (cis), especially for urban areas. however, current approaches for ci modeling, monitoring, and resilience assessment are lacking a holistic view of cities as complex, interconnected, and socio-technical systems. this paper explores the application of the digital twin (dt) concept as a promising tool to assess and improve the resilience of urban cis in light of various hazards. dts are virtual real-time representations of a physical system that can be used to perform real-time analysis, simulate what-if scenarios, and provide decision support, during crises and normal operations. to this end, we identify and discuss key challenges for the development of urban digital twins (udts), including data management, technical and social modeling of cis, integrated ci co-simulations, model validation, and resilience assessment. to address the complex nature of urban areas as systems-of-systems, we present overarching modeling concepts by considering ci interdependencies and socio-technical interactions, resulting in the concept of the socio-technical digital twin (stdt). beside incorporating agent-based modeling, we discuss the issue of demand synchronization and propose the concepts of model selection and model transfer to facilitate the modeling process for udts. furthermore, a multi-layered modeling framework for interdependent urban cis is presented, where the proposed concepts are integrated and an overview and discussion of the technical and social modeling of cis is provided, with a particular focus on the power, water, and transportation domain. finally, we deal with the quantitative resilience assessment for interconnected cis and discuss ways of integrating these methodologies in dts. our approach frames cis as socio-technical systems and integrates the human perspective into the modeling process and resilience assessment. the presented modeling framework can be used to simulate various scenarios for analyzing their consequences in advance and measuring resilience in a holistic context. moreover, the proposed concepts and modeling approaches can support future developments towards udts for crisis management.",

    "abstract": "the accurate extraction of building roof structures from aerial imagery represents a fundamental task for urban digital twin systems, facilitating critical applications such as 3d city modeling and solar potential assessment. despite recent advancements in geospatial artificial intelligence, existing methods frequently encounter challenges posed by real-world complexities. these include structural heterogeneity caused by diverse architectural styles, discontinuities in roof structures due to occlusions from vegetation and other obstacles, and the limited generalization ability of models stemming from the scarcity of specialized annotated datasets. in this paper, we introduce an end-to-end network called roofmapnet, specifically designed for extracting roof structures. first, we propose a strategy for roof junction extraction that integrates dynamic gaussian heatmaps with quadratic coordinate calibration. this strategy enhances the model\u2019s robustness in junction prediction under heterogeneous sample distribution scenarios. to address the loss or blurring of roof lines caused by occlusion and shadow, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware module. this module employs a bidirectional mapping between geometric and feature spaces to refine candidate lines accurately, thus improving the model\u2019s generalization ability and robustness in roof line detection. additionally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of roof structure detection models, we meticulously annotated a diverse, large-scale remote sensing imagery dataset for roof structure extraction, named roofmapset. comprehensive evaluations on the vwb and roofmapset datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with mean sap improvements of 4.13% and 2.85% over competitors, respectively. further analyses confirm the resilience to varying spatial resolutions and complex occlusion patterns. our code and data are available at: https://github.com/cveo/roofmapnet.",

    "title": "conceptualizing i3s encoding for ogc citygml 3.0 building model",
    "abstract": "web-based visualization of large-scale 3d city models and urban digital twins is essential for various applications, such as urban planning, infrastructure management, environmental analysis, and public participation. the widely used ogc citygml standard to store semantically rich large-scale 3d city models is not well suited for web-based visualization due to its gml encoding. the conversion of citygml-based 3d city models to web-friendly formats like 3d tiles and i3s often leads to data loss due to the inability of such streaming formats in preserving hierarchical organization and semantic relationships inherent in the citygml data model. additionally, inconsistencies may arise during maintenance or updates primarily due to the secondary usage of these formats rather than being used as a direct encoding. therefore, in this paper, we present the concept of using i3s as a direct encoding for citygml 3.0. the recently released citygml 3.0 version distinctly separates its conceptual data model from the data encoding. this significant change enables the provision of additional encoding specifications beyond gml, a capability that was not possible in the previous version, citygml 2.0. this opens a new paradigm where citygml payloads could be optimized using existing 3d encodings such as ogcs indexed 3d scene layers (i3s) standard, designed to support 3d streaming and distribution of large volumes of 3d content through a combination of level of detail (lod) and selection criteria. the advantage of citygml i3s encoding is that it combines a semantically rich 3d city model with a bounding volume hierarchy (bvh) optimized for streaming large-scale 3d city models in multiple resolutions. a new capability that enables the consumption of citygml content, without data conversion, directly in web-enabled systems. to demonstrate this concept, we evaluated the suitability of encoding a citygml 3.0 indoor model for one of the stuttgart university of applied sciences (hft stuttgart) campus buildings, using i3s building scene layer (bsl). i3s bsl is a new enhancement provided in the ogc i3s version 1.3 community standard enabling the representation of building elements, such as roofs, walls, floors, doors, windows, etc., in a hierarchical structure of layers and sub-layers, combined with bvh optimization. the results proved that the i3s bsl format successfully preserves the geometry, hierarchical organization, and semantic relationships among citygml building classes, surpassing the capabilities of a generic citygml conversion-based implementations and therefore making a promising foundation for an enhancement of the citygml 3.0 building model using i3s encoding. this concept can be further extended in the future to other thematic modules of citygml 3.0, for further development of i3s encoding of citygml 3.0.",

    "abstract": "abstract. urban digital twins are becoming increasingly popular across various domains, including urban planning and studies of cultural heritage. however, current digital twins lack an important aspect compared to their physical counterparts: the ability to exchange, discuss, and mediate in a dedicated location around a specific object. we require a place where we can exchange with experts, similar to what we can do on a university campus, and support participative science. in this article, we propose imuv, a flying campus integrated with the urban digital twin. imuv not only supports 3d urban visualization but also provides an online space where users can exchange and collaborate in both the real-world and online environments. we describe the conception, development, and evaluation of the proposed platform, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between physical and virtual urban environments and facilitate collaborative decision-making processes. with the evolution of modes of working, such as remote work, we are also studying how online spaces can go beyond simple video conferencing. this article presents a proof-of-concept that can serve as a basis for such studies.",

    "abstract": "abstract. the process of ensuring efficient and safe urban transportation is closely linked to urban planning, particularly through the aspects of transportation planning. transportation planning is a pivotal concern for urban regions worldwide, reflecting the growing need to increase mobility while ensuring safety and sustainability in densely populated areas. this research focuses on developing a novel digital-twin-based approach for micro-traffic simulation to support data-driven decision-making for increasing traffic safety through scenario planning. leveraging the traffic data obtained through monitoring one of the busiest intersections in sofia city, this research workflow shows the effective integration of lidar data and the urban digital twin concept in intelligent transportation systems (its). the research addresses problems related to moving object classification, trajectory analysis, and reclassification of unrecognised objects by processing the lidar data, pre-processed in a .osef format, thereby transforming it to make it suitable for simulation. the proposed solution for the monitoring of urban traffic is demonstrated by the usage of sumo (simulation of urban mobility) for performing simulations and a random forest model for unrecognized object reclassification to pre-existing vehicles and pedestrian classes. the architecture of the proposed workflow can possibly be applied in other similar urban settings, providing a scalable solution for both traffic management and urban planning. the study\u2019s results support the wider use of urban digital twin principles in its by highlighting the value of advanced modelling tools and high-quality data in addressing today's urban transportation challenges.",

    "abstract": "the urban intelligence approach views the city as a complex system that needs to be studied through the interaction of its different subsystems. such complexity is addressed also in the virtual dimension, through the construction of urban digital twins that allow to understand, control, and optimize the urban dynamics according to multidimensional objectives.in this context, we describe here a model to assess and evaluate the risks incurred by pedestrians and vehicles in a city under severe and extreme rainfall events that results in increasing of surface runoff, causing pluvial floods. this study is motivated by the increasing frequency of extreme events that seriously challenge the urban infrastructures in historical cities where urban design dates back centuries and constraints to structural modifications of the urban texture are often present.the approach is based on the design and integration of two models: first, a traffic macro-simulation model that integrates multi-objective demand and resources in an optimal and automated way; such model, also referred to as the mobility digital twin, can predict vehicle and pedestrian flows over the segments of the city network. second, a model of water dynamics over the same city network (water digital twin), based on the morphological structure of the territory and on the 3d urban model, that integrates a hydrological-hydraulic coupled model that is able, starting from predetermined rainfall events, to estimate the water levels and flow rates in each portion of the investigated territory of rainfall.the two models are jointly used to create scenarios for different weather conditions, simulate recovery policies, identify the system&amp;#8217;s bottlenecks and design evacuation strategies, both at the strategic and at the operational level. the results of the experimentation will be analyzed and implemented within the sit. specifically, with intelligent sit, we define a framework for integrating data from diverse sources, including informative, participatory, and human-centric data, as well as outputs from thematic digital twins and other sources. to accurately represent complex systems, we rely on detailed maps and in-depth spatial analysis, made possible through the capabilities of the sit.a prototype application of the approach is developed for the city of matera, within the casa delle tecnologie emergenti project and the development of the city&amp;#8217;s urban digital twin. preliminary results validate the potential contribution of the models adopted and have been used to support local authorities in the design of recovery strategies in the presence of extreme weather events and in the planning of&amp;#160; mitigation actions on the city road network.acknowledgments this research was supported by the &amp;#8220;casa delle tecnologie emergenti di matera&amp;#8221; project.",

    "abstract": "abstract three\u2010dimensional (3d) geospatial technologies are essential in urban digital twins, smart cities, and metaverse. rendering large\u2010scale terrain data, often exceeding tens of terabytes, presents challenges. while planetary\u2010scale platforms, like google earth and cesium stream data, the streaming of data and the use of regular grid\u2010type digital elevation models lead to cracks among tiles with different levels of detail. this paper proposes a novel dynamic tile\u2010map generation method to eliminate these cracks. unlike existing methods, our approach leverages tile subindex information to efficiently construct a tile adjacency map, significant reducing the search space for neighboring tiles and eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the terrain tile structure. furthermore, our approach is robust to data loss, mitigating cracks caused by missing or incomplete tiles. compared with existing root\u2010down search methods, our method reduces processing time by 1\u20135 ms per frame and decreases the number of tile\u2010to\u2010tile links by a factor of 3\u20135, as demonstrated by experimental results.",

    "abstract": "this paper presents a methodology for correcting geometric and topological errors, specifically addressing fragmented and disconnected components in buildings (fdcb) in 3d models intended for urban digital twin (udt). the proposed two-stage approach combines geometric refinement via duplicate vertex removal with topological refinement using a novel spatial partitioning-based depth-first search (dfs) algorithm for connected mesh clustering. this spatial partitioning-based dfs significantly improves upon traditional graph traversal methods like standard dfs, breadth-first search (bfs), and union-find for connectivity analysis. experimental results demonstrate that the spatial dfs algorithm significantly improves computational speed, achieving processing times approximately seven times faster than standard dfs and 17 times faster than bfs. in addition, the proposed approach achieves a data size ratio of approximately 20% in the simplified mesh, compared to the 50\u201360% ratios typically observed with established techniques like quadric decimation and vertex clustering. this research enhances the quality and usability of 3d building models with fdcb issues for udt applications.",

    "abstract": "abstract digital twins, often fuelled by artificial intelligence (ai) and cloud, are currently one of the most debated technologies in the public sector. their potential to disrupt the traditional world of policy-making, empower users with new intelligence and facilitate urban operations have attracted the interest of policymakers, researchers and technologists alike. although adoption can deliver benefits ranging from faster, more transparent decision-making to more accurate and collaborative operations management, the public sector application of digital twin technology is still in relative infancy. as a result, quantitative and qualitative insights into the implementation and impact of digital twins remain thin, particularly at the local or urban level. this paper examines early use cases alongside implementation approaches and governance tools to identify the benefits and challenges inherent in replacing traditional urban policy-making and planning approaches with local digital twins (ldt) to force multiply or bolster outcomes. it argues that greater multi-stakeholder experimentation, research and collaboration is needed in the urban digital twin space in order to develop effective governance solutions that support and scale more comprehensive public sector transformation aims.",

    "abstract": "grounded in the emerging paradigm of industry 5.0, this article explores how the human\u2010centric, sustainable and resilient principles that characterise the new industrial wave can equip geography with fresh analytical and operational tools for confronting the ecological crisis. starting from the notion of territorial co\u2010design, we examine the double challenge of the twin transition\u2014digital and green\u2014and its implications for the re\u2010organisation of places at every scale. drawing on the paradigmatic contribution of kate raworth\u2019s doughnut economics, we position industry 5.0 within a wider constellation of alternative economic models and circular\u2010economy strategies. two case studies\u2014the reshare project in oslo and the urban digital twin of matera\u2014illustrate how shared\u2010mobility platforms, distributed micro\u2010manufacturing and data\u2010driven urban twins can foster inclusive, context\u2010sensitive and regenerative spatial practices. by integrating these empirical insights with a critical reading of territorial inequalities, the article foregrounds the role of geography in mediating between technological potential and socio\u2010ecological constraints. ultimately, we argue that industry 5.0 can become a catalyst for a post\u2010anthropocene territoriality, where production ecosystems, local communities and the biosphere are co\u2010designed rather than merely co\u2010located.",

    "abstract": "open government data (ogd) plays a crucial role in transforming smart cities into sustainable and intelligent entities by providing data for analytics, real-time monitoring, and informed decision-making. this data is increasingly used in urban digital twins, enhancing city management through stakeholder collaboration. however, local administrative data remains underutilized even in digitally advanced countries like estonia. this study explores barriers preventing estonian municipalities from sharing ogd, using a qualitative approach through interviews with estonian municipalities and drawing on the ogd-adapted innovation resistance theory model (irt). interviews with local government officials highlight ongoing is-sues in data provision and quality. by addressing overlooked weaknesses in the estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. additionally, by validating the ogd-adapted innovation resistance theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local ogd initiatives, ensuring the full utilization of ogd in smart city development.",

    "abstract": "smart cities are transforming urban living by leveraging technology and data to optimize urban services, to improve resource efficiency, and to promote sustainability. urban digital twins (udts) promise to play a central enabling role in this transformation. however, state-of-the-art digital twin models still have to address significant challenging issues, particularly in terms of interoperability and integration with complex and multilayered (often legacy) urban systems. some emerging approaches rely on specific standards and ontologies, creating\u201dinformation silos\u201d peculiar to each digital twin solution. after discussing the related and still open technical challenges, this paper proposes a novel extension of the glassbox urban simulation model to conceptualize a city as a multilayered network, where nodes can be entities at different levels of granularity, such as a single building, a urban energy network, or even an aggregated urban area. our proposed solution aims to ensure interoperability between these layers by enabling seamless real-time data exchange and optimized resource management. furthermore, integration between layers such as energy, transportation, and water is essential to ensure data synchronization and provide the basis for more advanced smart city services, e.g., energy consumption/production prediction. to practically exemplify the advantages of the proposed approach, our innovative model is also illustrated when supporting a case study that focuses on urban transportation systems.",

    "abstract": "abstract. trees on city streets are the valuable resource for the pedestrian comfort and mitigation of effects of the urban heat island. solar studies at the city and district scales can be conducted in 3d using various tools. however, 3d city models often lack the geometry of high vegetation in solar analysis, as tree representation is more complex compared to buildings. while this omission is not critical for the assessment of rooftops, shading from trees significantly affects pedestrian comfort on the street in the summer, building-integrated photovoltaics on fa\u00e7ades, and energy consumption of buildings. this paper presents a 3d solar analysis that integrates trees into studies at the district scale using a widely adopted 3d raytracing algorithm. the study area covers 9.24 km2, evaluating 1,056,482 faces and incorporating 34,617 trees. tree transmissivity is accounted for with separate calculations and post-processing of the output datasets. the study demonstrated up to a 30% decrease in solar radiation on streets compared to analysis that excludes trees, as well as an 18% increase in solar access to street surfaces compared to raster-based calculations in gis. the resulting analytical datasets are integrated into the urban digital twin of sofia using open standards such as citygml and 3d tiles. citygml vegetation ade is reviewed to incorporate the proposed workflow. this approach offers a straightforward solution for assessing the impact of tree shade with modest computation time and can be scaled to the city level in future research.",

    "abstract": "cities globally are at the epicenter of socioeconomic and technological advances but are also disproportionately impacted by weather extremes. interestingly, while cities are affected by the large-scale weather patterns, cities themselves create thermodynamical feedback which affects local and regional meteorology. the changes in temperature due to urban growth are likely most recognizable as 'urban heat islands' (uhis). these uhis are indicators of the systemic changes that are dynamically underway- with the temperature changes affecting the local humidity, local scale convergence, and potential for cloud-convection processes, and in some instances changes in the precipitation characteristics.&amp;#160; these changes in the meteorological parameters have now been well documented and a consistent signature and understanding emerging that emphatically highlights that cities change local weather and climate.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;given this understanding of the state of the science, the next question that comes up is how can we then design cities that can create regionally \"desired\" weather and climate for the cities- or at the very least reduce the exposure to the climatic extremes and the vulnerability.&amp;#160; this invited presentation will discuss the evolution of the community's understanding of urban science and the efforts underway to translate this synthesis from being useful to usable and actionable for city operations, decision-making, and planning activities that can help build resilience.&amp;#160; the talk will also discuss how the information from upcoming assessments such as the ipcc special report on cities and climate and related activities will need to be leveraged by cities globally, through local municipal- academia - community colabs, urban digital twins, and community and consensus building regarding data governance, ethics, experimental testbed, and experiential outcomes that can be scaled, adapted, and engaged for cities globally.&amp;#160;",

    "abstract": "quantum computing (qc), rooted in the principles of superposition and entanglement, enables transformative computational capabilities that surpass classical systems, particularly in solving np-hard combinatorial optimization, simulation, and machine learning problems. these capabilities are increasingly vital for smart cities, which depend on real-time data from the internet of things (iot) devices, artificial intelligence (ai), and urban digital twins (udts) to orchestrate complex urban systems such as traffic, energy, logistics, and public safety. as global urbanization accelerates, the demand for hyper-efficient, secure, and adaptive infrastructure exceeds the limits of classical computation. this study employs a multi-pronged methodology that combines literature synthesis, algorithmic mapping, and strategic roadmap design. this study investigates the strategic alignment between qc and the computational demands of next-generation urban environments, with a specific focus on saudi arabia\u2019s greenfield megaprojects, including neom, the line, and the red sea project, within the saudi vision 2030 framework. the analysis systematically maps urban computational challenges to applicable quantum algorithm families\u2014quantum approximate optimization algorithm (qaoa), variational quantum eigensolver (vqe), and quantum machine learning (qml)\u2014and synthesizes the technical, organizational, financial, ethical, and regulatory prerequisites for national deployment. the core contribution is the development of a conceptual hybrid quantum-classical architecture (hqca) and a methodologically grounded three-phase deployment roadmap, tailored to the saudi context, mapping quantum technical readiness to policy and infrastructure milestones in saudi arabia. this framework positions saudi arabia to pioneer quantum-accelerated urban systems, enabling resilient infrastructure, sovereign digital capabilities, and global leadership in the emerging quantum city paradigm.",

    "title": "new spatial planning for the future \u2013 designing resilient, intelligent, and humane territories",
    "abstract": "this paper proposes a radical rethinking of spatial planning paradigms for the 21st century, offering a comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for urban futures shaped by complexity, climate urgency, digital disruption, and spatial justice. in contrast to static, technocratic models inherited from industrial-era planning, the study advances a vision of cities as adaptive, sentient, and co-produced systems. it introduces a suite of innovative approaches including algorithmic urbanism, bio- centric planning, dynamic zoning, participatory ai, regenerative landscapes, and ethics-driven governance. drawing from urban theory, environmental systems science, critical geography, and technological innovation, the research presents spatial planning as a creative, anticipatory, and reflexive practice \u2014 one that integrates digital intelligence, ecological interdependence, and human plurality. the core argument is that spatial planning must evolve from rigid regulatory control toward dynamic protocols, responsive morphologies, and inclusive ethics. it must empower planners not only as technicians of land use but as mediators of multispecies coexistence, stewards of planetary thresholds, and facilitators of collective agency. through a synthesis of emerging practices such as urban digital twins, post-gentrification zoning, open data platforms, and ai co-design systems, this work outlines a transition from cities as machines to cities as metabolic, intelligent, and just ecosystems. finally, it underscores the imperative of re-educating future planners as hybrid professionals equipped with critical theory, systems thinking, ethical coding, and climate foresight. the paper envisions planning as not merely a tool for shaping space, but a cultural and ethical medium for shaping shared futures. key words: spatial intelligence, algorithmic urbanism, bio-centric planning, dynamic zoning, participatory ai.",

    "title": "generation of digital terrain models from digital surfacemodels using a watershed transformation approach",
    "abstract": "the basis of urban digital twins are 3d city models generated from airborne or spaceborne remote sensing imagery. these remote sensing data allows the extraction of digital surface models (dsms) representing the absolute geographical height of each pixel together with orthorectified image mosaics. but for the derivation of a city model also the height of the urban objects and the height of the ground - the digital terrain model (dtm) - is needed. so in a first step there has to be a method to derive the digital terrain model (dtm) from the generated digital surface model (dsm). the extraction of dtms from dsms is already a basic task for many decades and there are many approaches but still there is no general fully satisfying solution for this demand. in this paper we present a novel method for deriving a dtm from a provided urban dsm based on the inverted watershed-transformation. the watershed-transformation normally fills up sinks in a dsm up to a ridge-line where two sinks meet. so the result is a segmentation of a dsm to distinct sinks. using the inverted watershed-transformation delivers a segmentation to single elevated objects. the boundary points where each of these elevated segments meet are taken as possible candidates for ground areas. but such boundaries may also lie for example between adjacent roofs. using a dynamically determined threshold in the height distribution of each watershed segment gives a possible ground candidate area of the segment. merging all ground candidate areas and taking only larger areas with special properties into account gives all ground candidates. keeping only the heights of these areas as real ground and filtering and filling them gives the final dtm. in the presented paper we describe the method in detail and apply the method to different dsms of rather flat and hilly urban and non-urban environments, discuss the results and give finally an evaluation of the quality of the results.",

    "abstract": "abstract: this study investigates an \u2018earth twinops\u2019 paradigm that couples geospatial artificial intelligence with quantum optimization to support climate\u2011resilient cities and electricity grids. the conceptual contribution is a cross\u2011layer operating model in which urban digital twins, grid digital twins, and edge\u2011to\u2011cloud decision loops are governed as a single socio\u2011technical system, allowing hazard signals (heat, pluvial flooding, and air\u2011quality stress proxies) to be translated into actionable infrastructure and operations decisions. the methodological contribution is a replicable pipeline that (i) standardizes multi\u2011source geospatial and infrastructure indicators into a coherent feature space, (ii) learns interpretable risk and service\u2011criticality relationships, and (iii) formulates a multi\u2011objective hub\u2011selection and resource\u2011allocation problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (qubo) instance for quantum\u2011inspired solvers. to satisfy end\u2011to\u2011end reproducibility in constrained data environments, the paper provides an embedded results section with a compact, clearly labeled illustrative dataset (eight indian metropolitan nodes and their associated state/ut grid contexts) and demonstrates how the proposed metrics, models, and optimization workflow produce decision\u2011relevant outputs (priority ranking, hub placement, coverage trade\u2011offs, and sensitivity to governance weights). the findings indicate that earth twinops is technically feasible using contemporary geospatial pipelines and hybrid quantum\u2013classical optimization, but practical deployment depends on data governance, interoperability, and institutional capacity to operationalize accountability at the city\u2013grid interface. policy implications emphasize standards\u2011based data sharing, climate\u2011aligned public procurement, and phased capacity building that enables trustworthy automation from municipal operations to state\u2011level dispatch and investment planning. keywords digital twins; twinops; geospatial ai; climate resilience; electricity grids; quantum optimization; qubo; edge computing; urban infrastructure governance.",

    "title": "model-driven integration of heterogeneous n-dimensional urban data",
    "abstract": "urbanization and anthropization are dynamic and multifaceted change processes with strong impacts on our societies. to confront the increasing need for understanding these processes, data-driven approaches such as urban digital twins and smart city applications have become powerful solutions to model, visualize, and navigate the complex urban landscape and lifecycle. often, these approaches rely on integrating these urban data, which consist of a variety of different information from different actors and organizations. in this context, urban data integration is a process that combines heterogeneous urban data from these information domains to create more complete data views of the urban landscape and its evolution for the user. to provide these views, the integration process must take into consideration both the heterogeneous nature of this data and its n-dimensional (nd) characteristics (i.e., 2d, 3d, time, semantics).the aim of this thesis is to propose a robust semantic and approach to data integration based on standards and models, where the conceptual models underlying the different data sources are preserved. instead of using direct data conversion, we propose a model-driven methodology to ensure that, for a given application, all the information that can be represented by a given standard will be available to the application, even if the standards and the data models they define implicitly evolve. in this thesis, we focus on nd urban data\u2014and in particular, on 3d and temporal urban data. building a robust semantic model is challenging, as choosing an expressive semantic model requires a good understanding of the different types of information that can be represented by the various sources and the standards to which they belong. also, automated mapping of conceptual model information has a number of limitations.by considering heterogeneous constantly evolving nd urban data standards, our aim is to be able to ensure data interoperability and the possibility of integrating this data with other, related open data. this proposal also aims to improve access to geospatial data on the web, while guaranteeing its integrity and access.",

    "abstract": "this article analyzes opportunities for integrating artificial intelligence (ai) into the economy of the russian arctic through russian-chinese cooperation. the relevance of the study is determined by the growing competition for resources and logistical routes in the arctic, where ai can become a key catalyst for increasing efficiency, environmental sustainability, and the safety of economic activities. the purpose of the research is to identify priority areas and assess the potential for ai integration into the arctic economy via a russian-chinese partnership. the methods used include a systematic review of domestic and international sources, a comparative statistical analysis of macroeconomic indicators for russia and china, and a scenario-based forecasting model up to the year 2030. the novelty of the research lies in the development of a comprehensive roadmap for an ai project in the arctic, considering technological, infrastructural, environmental, and investment factors from both countries, along with a risk matrix and risk mitigation proposals. research results include a taxonomy of seven key ai application areas (ice monitoring, digital logistics of the northern sea route, intelligent resource extraction, big data infrastructure, and urban digital twins), a quantitative assessment of expected effects (logistics cost savings of approximately $2 billion per year, an increase in oil and gas project revenues of approximately $18\u201320 billion per year, a 30% reduction in accidents along the nsr, etc.), and a heat map highlighting bottlenecks and growth points for bilateral initiatives. the findings suggest that comprehensive ai integration could generate a cumulative economic effect of $45\u201360 billion by 2030 (approximately 15\u201320% of the gdp of russia's arctic regions and china\u2019s northeastern provinces), while simultaneously strengthening the region\u2019s environmental and social sustainability. future research should focus on developing unified data exchange protocols, creating joint ai testing sites, studying the social effects on indigenous peoples, and establishing a multi-level cybersecurity system for critical arctic infrastructure.",

    "title": "enhanced kinematic hierarchical filling-&amp;amp;-spilling algorithms for pluvial flooding: synthetic and real-case applications with comparative analysis to fully 2d models",
    "abstract": "pluvial floods, intensified by short-duration and high-intensity storms, are becoming increasingly frequent and severe due to climate change and urbanization. saferplaces addresses this with a digital twin platform that integrates high-resolution geospatial and climate data from sources such as google earth engine (gee), open street map (osm), microsoft planetary, amazon, and copernicus. these datasets are automatically integrated to construct detailed, multi-layered urban digital twins, enabling real-time flood hazard and risk modelling. as part of the saferplaces platform, safer_rain, a fast-processing hierarchical filling-&amp;amp;-spilling algorithm (hfsa), combines spatially distributed rainfall input and infiltration simulation through a pixel-based green-ampt model (see https://saferplaces.co/) and enabling building-by-building flood risk modeling across large urban areas. leveraging the platform&amp;#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure, safer_rain can efficiently run computationally intensive simulations at high resolution, delivering real-time results that support effective urban planning and climate resilience strategies. comparisons with traditional 2d hydrodynamic models revealed limitations in safer_rain, such as underestimation of flooded areas due to the lack of hydraulic backwater effect and single flow path constraints. we present significant enhancements of the saferplaces platform that were recently developed to address these challenges. these include: (1) incorporating a weir equation using a simplified kinematic approach to account for backwater effect, (2) introducing a travel-time distribution for water within watersheds and (3) implementing flow path flood extension using a height above nearest drainage (hand) approach. these improvements are tested in a synthetic case study and applied to a set of real flooding events in urban areas of pamplona, spain. with its ability to run scalable simulations in real time and integrate diverse datasets, safer_rain, as part of saferplaces' digital twin platform, offers a transformative solution for flood risk intelligence, empowering cities to build preparedness and enhance climate resilience.keyword: digital twin, hierarchical filling-&amp;amp;-spilling algorithms, 2d hydrodynamic models, pluvial flooding",

    "abstract": "traffic congestion, crashes, and emissions impose high social and economic costs worldwide. connected and autonomous vehicles (cavs) are poised to revolutionize urban mobility with unprecedented gains in efficiency, safety, and sustainability. however, fully realizing these benefits requires surmounting urgent challenges in accurately modeling complex cav traffic dynamics and safeguarding transportation networks against cyber-physical threats. traditional traffic flow models cannot capture the rich interactions and novel vulnerabilities of cav networks, leaving critical gaps in traffic congestion prediction and attack resilience. as a result, we lack reliable tools for network-level traffic-state estimation, vulnerability analysis, and resilient control in cav-dominated urban networks. in response, this dissertation develops a novel physics-informed deep learning framework that integrates fundamental traffic flow theory with modern neural networks and cybersecurity principles to enable network-level traffic-state estimation, vulnerability analysis, and resilient control for cav-dominated systems. methodologically, the framework integrates macroscopic traffic models with neural learning to serve as a data-enhanced \u201cdigital twin\u201d of urban traffic. an adaptive spatio-temporal decomposition technique is introduced to capture localized congestion waves while preserving traffic conservation laws, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency over classical approaches. to probe cav cybersecurity, we develop an adversarial route guidance attack model that exploits bounded-rational driver behavior (indifference to small delays) to coordinate network-wide traffic disruptions. simulations show that incorporating realistic user behavior yields more effective attacks (e.g., greater route compliance and network-wide congestion) than state-of-the-art models. we further devise a defense against traffic estimation via adversarial training and anomaly detection, shifting analytical trust from potentially corrupted data to physical traffic laws, maintaining high accuracy under sensor spoofing attacks where unprotected models fail. simulation and case-study results demonstrate that our physics-informed method achieves improvements by orders of magnitude in traffic-state prediction compared to conventional models, and that heterogeneous driver responses can buffer moderate cyberattacks (delaying congestion cascades and aiding recovery). however, under more severe coordinated attacks, even human behavioral diversity has its limits, leading to abrupt network breakdowns and highlighting the importance of the proposed security measures. by shifting reliance from potentially corrupted data to inviolable physical traffic laws, the robust estimator maintains high accuracy where naive models fail.this work bridges traffic flow theory, machine learning, and cybersecurity, contributing a novel physics-informed ai paradigm for traffic modeling that is both data-driven and grounded in first principles. by explicitly integrating adversarial dynamics and human behavioral realism, it extends the theory of transportation network resilience and pioneers new approaches to secure cav operations. in practice, the findings inform the design of next-generation intelligent transportation systems, from anomaly-aware routing and control strategies to security-aware urban digital twins, providing a foundation for resilient, real-time traffic management in the cav era.",

    "title": "designing public services through digital twins. a multi-scale perspective",
    "abstract": "governments face increasing pressure to optimize public services under constrained budgets and rising citizen expectations for accessible, high-quality services. digital twins (dts)\u2014virtual representations of physical systems\u2014offer new possibilities for resource optimization and decision-making. this research explores how service design (sd) can enhance dt integration in the public sector across different levels. the goal is to ensure that dts do not function solely as technological solutions but actively support service transformation, aligning with public needs and institutional objectives. for public administrations, digital twins enhance strategic planning, service efficiency, and civic engagement. examples include supporting local governments in forecasting urban development, managing utilities in innovation districts, simulating mobility scenarios, and collecting citizen input on infrastructure projects via digital platforms. the variety of these projects can obstruct the understanding of what tangible assets are twinned, underlining the first research gap, and engaging in the creation of the first framework. simultaneously, service design, as an interdisciplinary field, can provide skills of user research, strategic and operations management, interaction, and graphic design. however, sd\u2019s application in dt projects has often been limited to economic models, such as service-dominant logic. thus, the second research gap is the lack of knowledge on the role of service design in digital twin projects, covered by the creation of a second framework. this study employs an integrative literature review to identify key challenges, best practices, and opportunities for dts in public sector and service design methodologies. as a result, the study describes two interconnected frameworks: digital twin levels according to physical entities twinned and service design role in digital twin projects. the first introduces a classification of digital twin levels based on the physical scale of twinned entities, distinguishing between human, populations, equipment, building, living organisms, non-living components, and urban digital twins. the second framework accomplishes the previous one by explaining the service design role in digital twin projects through service design thinking phases (exploration, creation, reflection, and implementation), describing service design fields impact: user research (empathising through immersion), strategic management (creating sense of urgency and desire for the future, building trust, and managing complexity), operations management (mapping service systems, orchestrating feasible concepts, balancing efficiency and experience, and managing service transitions), interaction design (enhancing usability, and humanising technology), and graphic design (visualising complexity, reducing cognitive load, and promoting visual reliability). to connect two frameworks, the article describes what relevant service design disciplines can be activated for different dt levels. starting from human, population, and equipment dt, the main suitable fields can be user research and interaction design, while for living organisms, non-living components, building and urban dts, the main field may be strategic management. additionally, the study outlines the phd research plan, which explores dt integration across public services. this research reinforces the role of service design in making digital twins across different levels more human-centered, usable, and understandable to public services.",
